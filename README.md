Onkar Nath Singh: My Web Development Portfolio
Hi there! This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, a project I developed to showcase my skills and learning journey as a Computer Science and Engineering student. This site is an ongoing effort, reflecting my passion for web development and my commitment to mastering new technologies.

Building this portfolio allowed me to solidify my understanding of core web technologies. I primarily used HTML for structuring the content and CSS for bringing the design to life. To add a dynamic and engaging touch, I incorporated subtle animations using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), which was a fantastic experience in learning how to create smooth, performant visual effects.

On the website, you'll find an "About Me" section that introduces my interests, a clear list of my current skills (including HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics, and Python basics), and my contact information. My goal for this project was to create a clean, responsive, and user-friendly experience.

This portfolio represents my foundational abilities and my drive to continuously learn and improve. I'm excited about applying these skills to more complex projects and contributing to the tech community. Feel free to explore the code!
